TwilightSLAM project created at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor with the objective of investigating state-of-the-art technologies for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) tasks in low-light or twilight-like environments.

As this project operates in correspondence with various libraries and core algorithmic frameworks (keeping in mind quick real-time implementation ability), system requirements vary for each repository. Each image enhancment module and SLAM framework has a detailed readme associated in the corresponding directory for smooth implementation of our combined Twilight SLAM architectures.

For a brief overview of our project, we recommend watching our presentation on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe87hcqmZm0). For a more indepth look at our project and the results, you can find the PDF of our report [here](https://github.com/TwilightSLAM/TwilightSLAM/blob/main/Twilight_SLAM_Final_Report.pdf) or on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11310)

_Each type of SLAM implementation has a detailed readme associated in the corresponding directory for smooth implementation of our combined Twilight SLAM architectures._
Go Blue!

P.S. 
**this is a combined and updated implementation with recent python and C++ library changes to our original [project](https://github.com/TwilightSLAM) for concise viewing and version-based bug free experience**
